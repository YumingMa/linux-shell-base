Non-executable files containing aliases, short functions and one-liners.

## Aliases

Like the solutions in the bin/ directory, these aliases are meant to be sourced all at once.

* **aliases-info.bash**: Aliases/short functions providing information only (no actions performed).
* **aliases.bash**: Aliases/short functions performing an action.

### Notes

* Some aliases contain environment variables (e.g. ${EDITOR}) which the user must either define or replace if possible.
