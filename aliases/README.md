Aliases and short functions.

## Aliases

Like the solutions in the bin/ directory, these solutions are ***not*** meant to be retrieved and sourced all at once although they can be.

* **aliases-info.bash**: Aliases and short functions providing information only (no actions performed).
* **aliases.bash**: Aliases and short functions performing an action.

### Notes

* Some aliases contain environment variables (e.g. ${EDITOR}) which the user must either define or replace if possible.
